# FlatPaper

FlatPaper is a Hexo theme inspired by flat illustrations and paper cards, featuring dashed outlines, sticky notes, tape strips, and a soft low-contrast reading interface. The theme is built with modular Stylus partials and a small EJS template layer, with no runtime dependencies.

## Highlights

- **Adaptive layout**: three columns on the home / list pages, two columns on post pages, and a single-column drawer mode on narrow screens.
- **Sticky sidebars**: home / list page sidebars stick inside the viewport; the post page TOC stays sticky across the full article range.
- **Featured carousel**: pin up to four posts in `_config.yml`, with automatic rotation and hover-to-pause support.
- **Cover images**: reads `post.cover` / `thumbnail` / `image` / `banner` / the first inline `<img>` in the rendered post body; falls back to a CSS scene when no image exists.
- **macOS-style code blocks**: language badge (auto-detected, hidden for plaintext), copy and collapse buttons; supports `dark` / `sand` / `light` code themes.
- **Hexo NexT-compatible tags**: `{% note %}` (6 styles, foldable) and `{% tabs %}` (with collapsible mode); note also accepts the VitePress-style `::: type [title] ... :::` container syntax.
- **Pages routed by `type:`**: set `type: link | tags | categories` in front-matter to route to a custom layout (the more common `layout:` field still works).
- **Friends page**: `/links/` supports grouped cards, avatar fallback, per-link RSS badges, and a hover signal-pulse animation.
- **In-page search**: global Ctrl+K / Cmd+K popup backed by an inline JSON index of all posts (large sites can cap the count with `search.limit` in `_config.yml`).
- **Dark mode**: single-class toggle, persisted to `localStorage`; every component has a dark variant.
- **Configurable footer**: write custom copy with `{year}` and `{name}` placeholders.
- **Icons via Lucide**: icons are embedded as inline SVG (no network, no font), and every theme icon is driven by the same EJS partial.

## Quick Start

```bash
# inside your Hexo site
cd themes
git clone <this-repo> flatpaper
# or copy this folder directly

# enable it in <site>/_config.yml
theme: flatpaper

# copy and edit the theme config
cp themes/flatpaper/_config.yml _config.flatpaper.yml

hexo g && hexo s
```

Open <http://localhost:4000>.

Recommended pagination settings in the **site** `_config.yml`:

```yaml
index_generator:
  per_page: 10
  order_by: -date

per_page: 10
```

To enable an RSS feed:

```bash
pnpm add hexo-generator-feed
```

```yaml
# site _config.yml
feed:
  enable: true
  type: atom
  path: atom.xml
  limit: 20
  content: true
```

## Theme Configuration

All options live in `themes/flatpaper/_config.yml`.
The correct approach is to copy it to `<site>/_config.flatpaper.yml` before editing.

> The site name (brand text in the header) and `<meta name="description">` are read directly from the Hexo site `_config.yml` (`title` and `description`); the theme no longer duplicates them.

```yaml
menu:                                 # primary nav; string paths are still supported

  label: Today's note
  title: Write the days down slowly
  text: A place to collect small moments that are too quiet for social feeds.
  cta_text: Start reading             # CTA button label at the bottom of the card
  cta_link: archives/                 # CTA button link (passed through url_for)

tags:
  style: tape                         # "tape" or "pill"

featured:                             # up to 4 pinned posts on the home page
  - hello-world                       # slug / full path / last path segment / title

featured_autoplay: 5000               # milliseconds; 0 disables it

tape:
  enable: true                        # false hides all tape decorations

footer:                               # HTML allowed; interpolates {year} and {name}
  left: '&copy; {year} FlatPaper. All rights reserved.'
  right: 'Made with &hearts; by {name}'

code:
  theme: sand                         # "dark", "sand", or "light"

umami:                                # Umami analytics; no script is injected when disabled
  enable: false
  host: analytics.example.com         # Umami service domain (no scheme, no path)
  website_id: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  domains: example.com,www.example.com # optional; only report on these hostnames
```

When Umami is enabled, the following snippet is injected right before `</head>`:

```html
<script defer src="https://<host>/script.js" data-website-id="<website_id>" data-domains="..."></script>
```

- `host` only accepts plain `domain` or `domain:port` values (e.g. `analytics.example.com`, `localhost:3000`). A leading `https://` is stripped automatically; anything containing other characters is rejected and no script is injected.
- `domains` is Umami's built-in **blog-domain allowlist**: the tracker only reports when the visiting page's `hostname` matches an entry, which is the cleanest way to keep `localhost`, ephemeral preview URLs, or sites cloned and redeployed by others out of your stats. The field is optional; both a comma-separated string and a YAML list are accepted.

### UI Options and Current Defaults

- `menu` format, with icons resolved by `layout/_partial/icons.ejs`.

```yml
# Form 1
# Here Home is the display text, and / is the link path.
menu:
  Home: /
  Archives: /archives/
  About: /about/

# Form 2
menu:
  - path: /
    label: Home
    icon: home

  - path: /archives/
    name: Archives
    icon: archive
```

- Internal separators that may move while scrolling use native `1px dashed` borders where possible; outer paper / card outlines stay `2px dashed`.
- `tags.style` controls tag chips globally: `tape` uses lightly rotated small tape strips, while `pill` uses rounded capsules.
- Home and post interaction elements consistently use Lucide icons: latest posts, related posts, top navigation links, and "view more" arrows all render through the shared icon partial.
- `code.theme` supports `dark`, `sand`, and `light`. `sand` is the warm cream code theme; `light` is the white code theme.

### Featured Carousel

- `featured` accepts post slugs, full permalink paths, the last path segment, or exact titles. Matching is case-insensitive.
- It renders only on **page 1** of the home pagination.
- 1 post renders as a single static card. 2-4 posts render as a carousel with arrows, dot indicators, keyboard arrow support, and autoplay that pauses on hover / focus.

### Cover Images

```yaml
---
title: Weekend Walk
date: 2026-05-16
cover: /images/walk.jpg               # or an absolute URL
---
```

Resolution order: `cover` -> `thumbnail` -> `image` -> `banner` -> the first inline `<img>` in the rendered body. The first match wins. If none exist, the theme falls back to a CSS scene (sun + clouds + mountains / computer / camera).

Images use `object-fit: cover; object-position: 50% 50%`, so wide images keep the visible vertical centerline.

### Related Posts

Post pages automatically append a **standalone "Related Posts" card** below the article. Scoring:

- Each shared category +3
- Each shared tag +2
- Posts with a 0 score are excluded entirely; when no related posts exist, the card does not render
- When scores tie, newer posts win

Set `related_posts` (or fall back to `recent_posts`) to control how many cards are shown.

### Search

Click the magnifier button in the header, or press **Ctrl + K / Cmd + K** anywhere. Press **Esc** to close. Results are filtered from an inline JSON index of the most recent 120 posts (title + 200-character excerpt). Keywords are highlighted with `<mark>`.

### Dark Mode

The circular toggle button in the header stores state in `localStorage['flatpaper-mode']`. The toggle reads the stored state before paint to avoid FOUC.

### Code Block Theme

`code.theme` accepts `dark`, `sand`, or `light`. `sand` is the cream / light code theme; `light` is the white code theme. The value is written to `<body data-code-theme="...">`, and a CSS scope covers all code blocks.

Per-block UI:

- macOS-style title bar with three colored dots
- Language badge on the left, auto-detected from the highlight.js class (for example `figure.highlight.js -> JavaScript`). `plain / plaintext / text / txt / none / raw` resolve to empty and hide the badge.
- Copy support
- Collapse support (chevron, rotates 180 degrees)

## Custom Tags (Hexo NexT Compatible)

### `{% note %}`

```
{% note success %}
  A success note
{% endnote %}

{% note warning Notice %}
  When a title is provided, the note renders as a foldable <details>.
{% endnote %}
```

Supported types: `default`, `primary`, `success`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`. Adding a title turns the note into a foldable disclosure (native `<details>`, no JS needed).

You can also use the VitePress-style container syntax, which is **fully equivalent** to the tag above:

```
::: success
A success note
:::

::: warning Notice
When a title is provided, the note renders as a foldable <details>.
:::
```

The `:::` rewrite happens at `before_post_render`, and any `:::` inside fenced (``` / ~~~) or 4-space-indented code is preserved verbatim. Both syntaxes can be mixed freely within a single post.

### `{% tabs %}`

```
{% tabs Tab, 1 %}
<!-- tab -->
**Tab 1**
<!-- endtab -->
<!-- tab Custom name -->
Content...
<!-- endtab -->
{% endtabs %}
```

- First argument: base name used when an individual tab does not provide one (`Tab 1`, `Tab 2`, ...).
- Second argument: 1-based default tab index. Use **`-1`** for collapsed mode: all tabs start closed, click to expand, and click again to collapse.

## Special Pages

Front-matter `type:` routes `source/<dir>/index.md` to a custom layout (the original `layout:` still works as a fallback):

```yaml
---
title: Links
type: links            # or: tags, categories
---
```

Recognized values: `links`, `tags`, `categories`. Anything else / missing value -> default page layout.

### Friends Page (`type: links`)

Data lives in `source/_data/links.yml`. Multiple groups are supported:

```yaml
- class_name: DEMO
  class_desc: Example links to common development and documentation sites, used to test friend-link card rendering.
  flink_style: demo
  link_list:
    - name: GitHub
      link: https://github.com/
      avatar: https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg
      descr: Code hosting and collaboration platform for developers.
      rss:  # optional, shows an RSS badge on the card
```

Cards include: avatar (first-letter fallback when missing) + name + description. RSS badges are always visible, and play a "signal-pulse" animation on hover (icon wiggle + outward ring). The markdown body below the front-matter renders normally and is separated with a dashed rule.

## Layout

| Layout         | File                           | Purpose                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Home           | `layout/index.ejs`             | Featured carousel + paginated post grid          |
| Post           | `layout/post.ejs`              | Two-column article + reactions + previous / next + related posts card |
| Page           | `layout/page.ejs`              | Default page; routes to a custom layout by `type:` |
| Friends        | `layout/link.ejs`              | Friends grid + optional markdown body            |
| Archive        | `layout/archive.ejs`           | Date-grouped post list + pagination              |
| Category index | `layout/categories.ejs`        | Tag-cloud-like compact grid                      |
| Category       | `layout/category.ejs`          | Posts under one category + pagination            |
| Tag index      | `layout/tags.ejs`              | Tag cloud                                        |
| Tag            | `layout/tag.ejs`               | Posts under one tag + pagination                 |

Shared partials in `layout/_partial/`:

- `head.ejs`: meta + stylesheet
- `header.ejs`: brand, navigation, search, theme toggle, drawer toggle (narrow screens only)
- `footer.ejs`: configurable footer with `{year}` / `{name}` template tokens
- `sidebar-left.ejs` / `sidebar-right.ejs`: see the sidebar layout note below
- `recent-posts.ejs`: reusable "Recent Posts" card
- `post-card.ejs`: home / grid card with edge-bleed thumbnail
- `archive-list.ejs`: paginated archive / category / tag list
- `thumbnail.ejs`: real cover image and CSS-scene fallback
- `search.ejs`: popup dialog + inline JSON index
- `icons.ejs`: Lucide icon lookup

### Sidebar Layout Note

In the DOM, the visual **left** column is rendered by `sidebar-right.ejs` (profile, post page TOC, home categories / tags), while the visual **right** column comes from `sidebar-left.ejs` (home welcome card, recent posts). This order makes the more useful "left" panel become the hamburger-controlled drawer on narrow screens.

Post pages skip `sidebar-left` entirely and keep only one sidebar.
